# Hack Horsham

## Thing we should probably do or have in place

- DBS checks - this can be done for free with <https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors/join-stem-ambassador-programme>
I know it takes a bit of time to get sorted but it does help protect everyone involved.
<https://thestemhub.org.uk/docs/STEM-Ambassadors-Handbook.pdf>

- Policies: these should be a minimum and I'm
sure the code club has some we can have a look at and __inspire__ us.

  - Safeguarding
  - Code of Conduct for attendees

## The Venue

Current suggested [Laurie Apted building, Southwater RH13 9BT]([laurie-apted-building](https://www.theghyll.org/laurie-apted-building.html))


[More venues in Horsham area](https://www.hallshire.com/halls/search?keyword=horsham&county_id=&town_id=&country_id=&adv_searchfor=0&adv_searchtype=&adv_within=5&capacity=100)

Good:

- Has free parking
- Has a full kitchen
- tables and chairs - not all halls do
- wifi and as it is a new building so the line should be pretty fast there is fiber now in the village and to the local box.
- Accessability - it is new and on the ground floor
- easy drop-off of gear - the front door opens onto the road and you can park there to drop your stuff off
- Vinyl floor covering

Bad:

- Not Free to use.
- Not so easy access without a car although there is a bus stop just down the road that goes to Horsham - Worthing, Horsham- Brighton
- No storage of our gear

I do need to check phone signals
but it seems ok <https://checker.ofcom.org.uk/en-gb/mobile-coverage> and enter RH139BT

### Dates avaialable:

- 1st October 22 -- this date might be too soon now to make it viable? thoughts please || should this be online?
- 12th November 22
- 3rd or 17th December 22
- every 2nd Saturday in 2023

### Costs

---------

- Deposit   £50 repaid after final booking finished.
- Per session £32.4
- Total for 6 sessions £244

---------

So If 9 people turned up this would be  £3.60 each

Parking fees for the Council building is now £3.70 for 3 hours

---------

## Funding

At the moment we run as an UNINCORPORATED ASSOCIATIONS =>
[best explanation I have found](https://communitysouthwark.org/unincorporated-associations/)

We can stay that way unless we make over £5000 per annum
but we probably need some sort of constitution this would also then make it easier to apply for charity status if needed, or register with HMRC.

## Banking

At the moment we have no banking facilities, having one would make it easy to accept donations/grants.

Options:

- Treasures's bank account and these are available with no fees. [This one at Lloyds is free](https://www.lloydsbank.com/business/business-accounts/specialist-accounts/treasurers-account.html?WT.ac=lloyds-bb_and_sme-business_accounts-community-tile-treasurer-FOM)
- A Service like [Accountable](https://thesocialchangeagency.org/what-we-do/support-for-groups-and-movements/accountable/) their fees are 5% on incoming transactions (donations) plus £42 set up costs
  
Use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) as a way to show how our funds are used.
